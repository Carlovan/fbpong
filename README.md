#FrameBuffer Pong

This is a rewritten and simplified version of the classical electronic game Pong.  
It works only on Raspberry PI with a Linux OS.  
The game draws using framebuffer so it has to be enabled.

To control the game you need 2 potenziometers and an ADC model (MCP3208) wired useing the SPI bus.  
You can find the schematics in the file `circuit.png`.
